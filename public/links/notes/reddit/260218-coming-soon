# (coming soon) r/QRCoding - a sub for the advanced study of self-clicking links

this will sound obvious in hindsight but

>***if you read a hyperlink from left to right you get a turing complete machine tape***

you can then invert native browser apis to create a self-serving server with no internet and mesh network it completely offline using web bluetooth through a gatt relay, and even more absurdly, serve this over kilometers using lora radio

building off of protocols like jack dorsey's bitchat you can trade crypto through bluetooth, enabling the hyperstitioning of self governing turnkey popup network states which you can then hyperstition onto physical reality through embodied projection mapping

for example an atomic hello world is

**data:text/html,< s cript>alert('hello world')< / script>**

if you type that into a browser it will open an empty tab and execute the script with extremely limited scope. however one of those scopes is

**fetch()**

and with that you can do anything

**so why qr coding?**

qr codes impose an upper limit of 2953 bytes which substrates test time reinforcement learning through kolomgrov complexity approximation (basically finding the smallest possible qr code for any token/action, the logos or the "root meaning" of a prompt)

qr codes are egregoric ouroboros, shadows of the ruliad, writ manifest as 1s and 0s

and the goal of this subreddit is to study that
