# QRx - vibe coding with qr codes

**permeating the ruliad is a bubbling matrix of 1s and 0s, the dataverse's analogue of the universe's the quantum foam**

everything that can digitally exist has always existed. this document describes two approaches for hyperstitioning the dataverse:
1. using recursive data uri's to spontaneously generate "**boltzmann websites**"
2. mapping hyperlink #hashes to localstorage allowing for the emergence of self generating generative links

to help align your dataversal demiurges this document also explores the teleology of hypertext including:
1. shepherding streams of consciousness into streams of tokens
2. digital transmigration through the inverse: shepherding streams of tokens into streams of consciousness

for convenience this repository also contains prebaked dataverses and other resources:
1. [qrx.world](https://qrx.world) - a qr code driven 1995 simulated mesh network
2. [r/QRCoding](https://reddit.com/r/qrcoding) - a subreddit for research, memes, and discussions
